## ðŸ¦Š LunarFox

LunarFox is a performance integration pack with quality-of-life mods and OptiFine alternatives. The modpack includes some out-of-the-box mod configurations and good performance configurations.

Please note that for the NeoForge version: some mods are not compatible with NeoForge themselves, but are Fabric mods that use the [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) to implement the features in this modpack compatibility.

## ðŸŽ® Tips

If you want to use the Forgemetic (Litematic) mod, you need to change the Forgemetic (Litematic) mod shortcut key or the `Open World Map` shortcut key.
