## Pojav/FCL Notes

<Aside type="danger" title="Compatibility Warning">
  Please note that the LunarFox modpack is not designed for mobile devices, so
  compatibility on Pojav/FCL is not guaranteed. Using the LunarFox modpack on
  Pojav/FCL (or other mobile launchers) may cause game crashes or other issues.
  Please do not report any issues on Pojav/FCL.
</Aside>

If you are using the LunarFox modpack on Pojav/FCL, here are some suggestions that may be effective:

- Disable the ModernUI mod, as ModernUI mod may cause game crashes in most cases.
- Use a renderer that supports Sodium, such as Zink, LTW renderer.
- As of now, the LTW renderer is not compatible with Xaero's WorldMap/MiniMap mod, please use other map mods if necessary.
- As of now, the LTW renderer does not (fully) support shader rendering.
